Time complexity:
The time complexity for union and intersection both will be O(n+m) where n and m are sizes of linked list 1 and linked list 2.
We need to traverse them once to get data in set and then we do union, which will take O(n+m) and intersection, which takes O(min(n, m)) using set.

Space Complexity:
For union and intersection both space complexity will be O(n+m)
